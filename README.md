How to get started:
	1. Open file directory
	2. Open 'index.html' in any browser and continue from there!

	This site showcases many optimization techniques and performantly enhances the user experience in doing so.

Optimizations performed:
	1. Resizing of pictures with optimizilla.com and picresize.com
	2. Refactored CSS to include above-the-fold content on html load, also changed some media queries to perform better at larger resolutions
	3. Reworked floating pizzas to take move while scrolling better.
	4. Fixed pizza sizing slide tool to have zero jank.
	5. Changed call functions to more optimal choices to decrease DOM manipulation.
	6. Overall I made a performant site that I can be proud about.
